# passthrough-minifilter-driver
Windows mini-filter-driver. Blocks the access to USB drives.

Also I would like to mention here, this code is just for reference.
As I have built this 2-3 years back. , do not deploy it directly on live OS.
Use VM and deploy the code in host OS.

Right now I do not have bandwidth to work on it more. 
But please feel free to make any suggestions. I can then add you as a contributor to it.
